It‚Äôs not officially baseball season until the Phillies TV booth cries about a player on the other team doing something that isn‚Äôt remotely noteworthy.

I mean boo-hoo, guys, grow the hell up.

In lighter news, Phillies first round pick Justin Crawford had himself another night with Clearwater. He went 4-for-4 with a double and a triple, and is hitting .338 across 34 games this season.

He's still bashing balls into the ground, but he hits them hard and can really fly.

Dating back to last season, the Mets have won their last 7 series against the Phillies.

Justin Crawford collects his first career 4-hit game, tallying a triple and a double.

The #Phillies' 2022 first-rounder bumps his average up to .338 for Single-A Clearwater.

Is Trea Turner to the Phillies what Carl Crawford was to the Red Sox? @MLBNetwork

The Cincinnati Reds are now 2.5 games out of the wild card and have a better record than the Phillies and the Padres. A long way to go, but it's fun.

Justin Crawford is going to be a very good MLB player when he reaches the majors. Has the potential to be an All-Star and Gold Glove caliber player.

Feels like we‚Äôve been here before @NathanAckerman_ . Can lightning strike again? If the Phillies go 18-9 in June (which SHOULD be doable with this roster and that schedule) they will be 43-39 by July 1. Only then will I believe again. Otherwise, their dead to me.

Last year, after 55 games, the Phillies were 26-29

This year, they're 25-30. It's officially worse than last season. They were in the midst of a 10 game winning streak last year during this stretch of games. Only hope the beginning of June is when they heat up now like last year
